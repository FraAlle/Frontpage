# SNAKE PROJECT IN C
I helped an italian friend doing this for the Programming Engineer.
It's a snake game with some other stuff in:
    -At the start of the game you start with 1000 points, each time you take an '!' you will lose 10 points, if you take the '$' you earn 10 points.
    -At the start of the game you have 0 pass_wall, when you take the 'T' you earn 3 pass wall stack, it let you pass through the wall.
    -When you reach the '_' the game ends and it will give you how much points u made.
