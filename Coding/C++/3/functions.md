#FUNCTIONS
parameters passed by refer can be changed inside the functions.
U can use functions with pointers, in this case u will perform an parameter by value but it will be changeble bc we work with the posistion of the memory of that variable.
u can omit the parameters that are sets in the function definition. f.e. void new_greet(string greet, int repeats = 1) when the function in called there is no need to insert both values bc the second is already set as 1.
