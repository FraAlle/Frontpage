## CIA(Confidentiality Integrity and Avaiability)

CIA triad is a fundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

**Confidentiality** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
**Integrity** means the data is correct, authentic and reliable. Pro can use encryption to safeguard data.
**Avaiability** means data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk. The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk. [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) [NIST RMF](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf)
