## Risks
There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organizationâ€™s assets, including:

**External risk**: Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information

**Internal risk**: A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk

**Legacy systems**: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.

**Multiparty risk**: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.

**Software compliance/licensing**: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner
