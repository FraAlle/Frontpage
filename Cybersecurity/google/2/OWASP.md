## Open Web Apllication Security Project(OWASP)

*   The first OWASP principle is to minimize the attack surface area, it refears to all the potential vulnerabilities that a actor could exploit +  wich lead attacker to penetrate security defenses(phishing emails and weak passwords).
*   The secondo principle is defense in depht, it means that an organization should have multiple security controls that address ricks and threats in different ways. One example is the multi-factor authenticator.
*   Separation of duty olso as one big importances because can be used to prevent individuals from carrying out fraudulent or illegal activities.
*   Keeping the security simple is the next principle, when implementing security soulionts, these ones shouldn't be too complicated. The more complex the security controls are, the harder it is for people to work collaboratively.
*   The last principle is to fix issue correctly.
*   Establish secure defaults, this means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users, it should take extra works to make the app insecure.
*   Fail securely means that when a control fails or stop it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option(F.E. when an firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones instead accepting all of them).
*   Don't trust services, many organizations work with third-party partners, and these ones most of the time have differents security policies.
*   Avoid security by obscurity, the security of an app/web shouldn't come from making the souce code obscured but it should rely on other security factors.
